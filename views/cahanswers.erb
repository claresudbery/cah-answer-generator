<h2> What the hell is this? </h2>

<p>
  This app was created so that you can play <a href="https://clare-wiki.herokuapp.com/pages/think/life/Fun-Games#the-lip-reading-game">this lip-reading game</a>.
</p>
<p>
  All it does is randomly (ish) generate answers from the <a href="https://cardsagainsthumanity.com/"><b>Cards Against Humanity</b> game</a>.
</p>
<p>
  The answers are split into three categories:
</p>

<h3> 1. Safe for work </h3> 

<ul>
  <li>This is still Cards Against Humanity though. Somebody could get upset.</li>
	<li>If you're really worried, you'd probably better find a different source of phrases for your game!</li>
</ul>

<h3> 2. Kind of safe for work (assuming your work environment is quite relaxed) </h3> 

<ul>
  <li>All the safe answers plus some extra ones</li>
	<li>For example, sex is referred to but without the use of explicit language</li>
	<li>I mean, all I can really tell you is that I felt like I could cope with these phrases being used in a game with my (very relaxed) colleagues. Your mean may vary.</li>
</ul>

<h3> 3. Danger! Not guaranteed to be safe for work </h3> 

<ul>
  <li>ALL the answers</li>
</ul>
